#Information Technology (IT) <h1> tag
_Information Technology (IT)_ is the use of computers to store, retrive,
transmit and manipulate data or information, often in the context of a business or the enterprise.

_Technology system (IT system)_ is generally an information system, a communications system or more specially speaking, a computer system - including all hardware, software and peripheral equipment - operated by a limited group of users.
There are haev electronic data processing, among others:
1. Data storage
2. Databases
3. Data retrieval
4. Data transmission
5. Data manipulation

#The difference between Computer Science and Informatics <h1> tag
_Computer Science_ is study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.


_Informatics_ is a branch of information engineering. It involves the practice of information processing and the engineering of information systems, and as an academic field is an applied form of information science. The field considers the interaction between humans and information alongside the construction of interfaces, organisations, technologies and systems.

#Software development <h1> tag
_Software development_ is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing and bug fixing involved in creatin and maintaining applications, frameworks or other software components.

_Embedded software development_ that is, the developemnt of emebedded software, such as used for controlling consumer products, requires the development process to be integrated with the development of the controlled physical product.

_Methodologies_
A software development process is framework that is used to structure, plan, and control the process developing informatiion systems. There are several different approaches to software development: _some take a more structured, engineering-based approach to develop business solutions, whereas others may take a more incremental approach, where software evolves as it is developed piece-by-piece._ Most methodologies share some combinatio of the following stages of software development:
1. Analyzing the problem
2. Market research
3. Gathering requirements for the proposed business solution
4. Devising a plan or design for the software-based solution
5. Implementation (coding) of the software
6. testing the software
7. Deployment
8. Maintenance and bug fixing

_Software development activities_
1. Identification of need
	The sources of ideas for software products are plentiful. Software development may involve compromising or going beyond what is required by the client, a software development project may stray into less technical concerns such as human resources, risk management, intellectual property, budgeting, crisis management, etc. These processes may also cause the role of business development to overlap with software development.
2. Planning
	Planning is an objective of each and every activity, where we want to discover things that belong to the project. An important task in creating a software program is extracting the requirements or requirements analysis.
3. Designing
	The design of the software can be established in a software design document. This involves a preliminary or high-level design of the main modules with an overall picture (such as a block diagram) of how the parts fit together. 
4. Implementation, testing and documenting
	Implementation is the part of the process where software engineers actually program the code for the project.
	Software testing is an integral and important phase of the software development process. 
	Documenting the internal design of software for the purpose of future maintenance and enhancement is done throughout development. 
5. Deployment and maintenance
	Deployment starts directly after the code is appropriately tested, approved for release, and sold or otherwise distributed into a production environment. 
	Maintaining and enhancing software to cope with newly discovered faults or requirements can take substantial time and effort, as missed requirements may force redesign of the software.


#Agile Software development <h1> tag
Agile software development comprises various approaches to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s). The term agile was popularized, in this context, by the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and there have a values of the seventeen signatories to the manifesto proclaimed that they value:
1. **Individuaks and interactions** over proecess and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to Change** over following a plan.
That is to say, the items on the left are valued more than the items on the right. 
As Scott Ambler elucidated:
> Tools and processes are important, but it is more important to have
	competent people working together effectively.
> Good documentation is useful in helping people to understand how the
	software is built and how to use it, but the main point of development is to create software, not documentation.
> A contract is important but is no substitute for working closely with 
	customers to discover what they need.
> A project plan is important, but it must not be too rigid to 
	accommodate changes in technology or the environment, stakeholders' priorities, and people's understanding of the problem and its solution.

_Agile software development principles_

The Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on twelve principles:

1. Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable 
	software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
3. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
4. Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
5. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be 
	trusted
6. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication 
	(co-location)
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is 
	essential
11. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from 
	self-organizing teams
12. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and 
	adjusts accordingly
